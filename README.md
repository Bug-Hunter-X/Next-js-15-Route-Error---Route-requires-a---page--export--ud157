# Next.js 15 Route Error: `Route requires a "`page` export`

This repository demonstrates a common, yet often frustrating, error in Next.js 15 applications where the application throws an error indicating a missing `page` export despite the export being clearly present in the code.

## Issue

When running a Next.js 15 application, the following error may be thrown:

```
Error: Route requires a `page` export
```

This error is typically encountered even when a default export (or a named export called `page`) is defined for the page component. This issue can be caused by various factors including incorrect file structure, conflicting configurations, or subtle errors in the code.

## Solution

The solution often involves verifying several aspects of the application:

1. **Verify File Structure:** Ensure that the page component file (e.g., `pages/index.js`) adheres to the Next.js file structure conventions.
2. **Check Export:** Confirm that the `page` export (or the default export) is correctly defined within the component file.
3. **Restart Development Server:**  A simple restart of the development server can sometimes resolve transient issues.
4. **Clean Cache:** In some cases, clearing the cache might be necessary.
5. **Review Configuration:** Check your `next.config.js` for any conflicting configurations that might be affecting route resolution.

## Reproduction

This repository provides a minimal reproducible example to showcase the issue and its solution. By cloning and running the application, you can observe the error firsthand and then experiment with the provided solution.
